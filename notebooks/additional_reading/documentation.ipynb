    "Documentation is often one of the last considerations for academic/research code, but here we are going to establish **documentation as a high priority that should be taken seriously from the outset of any software development project**. This is because invariably small projects eventually morph into large projects with multiple contributors and an ever-growing code base. A concise guide to comments and docstrings in provided in 3.8 (Comments and Docstrings) of the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and for convenience we will in general follow the same recommendations. Further examples are available as part of the [Example Google Style Python Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html) for Sphinx."
