    "# IDE setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst you'll eventually settle on a development setup that suits your preferences, the following provides a basic overview for setting up an interactive development environment (IDE) for your software projects. Many tools are available, but I will focus on the setup I personally use and recommend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, this Python package includes auxiliary files in the root directory (such as `.vscode/settings.json`) that are related to IDE configuration. You are welcome to copy these settings into your own projects if you’d like to replicate the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether you're working with Python or another language, there are several key advantages to using an IDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Navigation**\n",
    "An IDE provides easy access to the files in your codebase and streamlines common tasks like editing, searching, copy-pasting, and moving between files or functions. Many IDEs also offer advanced features like file outlining, bookmarks, and quick navigation to definitions or references.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Formatting**\n",
    "Tools like black, ruff, or IDE-integrated formatters automatically format your code according to a consistent style guide. This saves time, eliminates debates over formatting, and ensures that code written by multiple contributors remains consistent and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linting**\n",
    "Linters automatically analyse your code for potential errors, style violations, and anti-patterns. They help catch bugs early, improve code quality, enforce team standards, and keep your project clean and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Type Checking**\n",
    "If your code includes type annotations, tools like `mypy` or `pyright` can verify type consistency. This helps catch subtle bugs before runtime and provides better integration with autocomplete and documentation features in the IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Autocomplete and IntelliSense**\n",
    "Modern IDEs offer powerful autocomplete and \"IntelliSense\" features, which suggest functions, methods, parameters, and even documentation as you type. This increases coding speed and reduces the need to constantly refer to documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Debugging Tools**\n",
    "IDEs typically include built-in debuggers, allowing you to step through your code, set breakpoints, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions in real time—essential for diagnosing complex issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Integrated Terminal and Environment Management**\n",
    "Many IDEs support integrated terminals and environment management, making it easy to run scripts, install dependencies, or activate virtual environments without switching windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Version Control Integration**\n",
    "Git integration allows you to commit, push, pull, resolve merge conflicts, and review diffs&mdash;all directly from within the IDE interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll now walk through each of these components in more detail, and I’ll show you how I configure my own environment. Note that my setup evolves over time as I discover new tools and best practices, and I’ll aim to keep this guide updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is necessarily compact and intended to give you a starting point. For further reading and more comprehensive information, please refer to the additional resources linked throughout the guide. These references provide in-depth explanations and up-to-date documentation for the tools and techniques mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic setup guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install VS Code**\n",
    "Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com. Extensive documentation is available at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understand Workspaces and Settings**\n",
    "A workspace in VS Code typically refers to the root folder of your project. VS Code can store configuration settings either globally (for your user) or locally (for a specific workspace):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - User Settings apply to all projects and are stored globally.\n",
    "    - Workspace Settings are stored in a ``.vscode/settings.json`` file inside the project folder and apply only to that project.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This distinction allows teams to share workspace-specific settings (such as formatters, linters, and interpreter paths) without affecting other projects or personal preferences. Using the same settings ensures consistency and prevents version control from detecting trivial formatting differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Recommended Extensions**\n",
    "Within VS Code, install the following extensions. These directly support the features described in points 2–5 of the previous section (formatting, linting, type checking, and autocomplete):\n",
    "    - **Pylance:** Provides fast, feature-rich language support for Python, including type checking via Pyright.\n",
    "    - **IntelliCode:** Offers AI-assisted code completions and improved suggestions based on context.\n",
    "    - **Ruff:** Enables ultra-fast linting and formatting within VS Code.\n",
    "    - **Jupyter** Adds support for Jupyter notebooks, which are required for running examples provided in this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I recommend installing these extensions system-wide, as they are beneficial for all (Python) projects. You can also explore extensions that support development in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Your Project**\n",
    "A few configuration files in the root directory of this project define workspace-specific behavior:\n",
    "    - **pyrightconfig.json**: Configures Pyright (used by Pylance) for type checking and diagnostics specific to this project.\n",
    "    - **ruff.toml**: Contains Ruff's linting and formatting rules tailored to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because these files live in the root directory, their settings apply only to this project (workspace in VS Code terminology). If you’d like to apply the same configuration to other projects, simply copy these files into the corresponding directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtain Python (package and project manager)\n",
    "There are many ways to install Python, but regardless of the approach, it is **strongly recommended to use isolated Python environments**. This helps keep projects separate and avoids conflicts between package dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast and modern Python package and project manager. Compared to traditional tools like `pip` and `venv`, `uv` offers a much faster installation experience, automatic environment creation, and seamless dependency resolution&mdash;all with a single command. `uv` works directly with standard Python tooling (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`) and integrates well with tools like `hatch`, `poetry`, or `pdm`. This makes it lightweight, compatible, and ideal for reproducible builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pyproject.toml` file is the standard configuration file for modern Python projects. It defines project metadata (like name, version, and dependencies) and can specify which tools are used for building, formatting, linting, or packaging. It replaces scattered config files (like `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tox.ini`) and allows tools to interoperate cleanly within a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum versions\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s always a trade-off between using the latest versions of Python and its packages versus maintaining backward compatibility to support users working with older environments. Supporting earlier versions can make it easier for others to integrate your software into their existing workflows, which may depend on legacy tools or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, I recommend targeting Python 3.10 as the minimum version. It introduced several useful enhancements, including improvements to dataclasses and expanded support for type annotations, both of which I make regular use of in my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your `pyproject.toml` clearly specifies the required Python version, along with the versions of any dependencies. This helps ensure consistent environments for both development and deployment, and prevents unexpected issues due to version mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional extensions\n",
    "The following VS Code extensions are optional but recommended to enhance productivity and improve code readability and documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **reStructuredText**: Provides support for editing and previewing .rst files, useful for Sphinx documentation.\n",
    "- **Todo Tree**: Highlights and organizes TODO comments across your project.\n",
    "- **Region Viewer**: Helps visualize and navigate code regions marked with #region/#endregion tags.\n",
    "- **autoDocstring**: Automatically generates docstring templates for Python functions and classes, following your preferred style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compilers and Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mac\n",
    "To install compilers and essential development tools on macOS, including Git, you only need the **Xcode Command Line Tools (CLT)**. This is sufficient unless you specifically plan to use Xcode as an IDE. The CLT includes core utilities such as `clang`, `make`, and `git`, but without the large overhead of the full Xcode package. It’s lightweight, quick to install, and ideal for most general software development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the CLT, open your terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    xcode-select --install\n",
    "\n",
    "This will trigger a system prompt to download and install the tools if they aren’t already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the installation, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    xcode-select -p\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a path that includes `CommandLineTools`. If not, you can manually set the CLT as the active developer directory using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that your system uses the correct toolchain for compiling and development tasks."
