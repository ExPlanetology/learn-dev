    "# Time to Refactor\n",
    "\n",
    "While writing this course, I often wondered whether to teach concepts from the perspective of a fresh start&mdash;assuming you have a blank slate to write new software&mdash;or from the perspective of inheriting (or being originally responsible for creating) a messy codebase that you're now reluctantly sifting through, trying to make sense of it and improve what you can in the limited time you have ... before some other unfortunate soul takes over.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Lecture, I'll mostly assume the latter. You have a codebase at hand that you're already using the scientific work. Mostly commonly, there simply isn't the time or resources to invest in a full clean-up with a dedicated specialist. It's down to you&mdash;and you know it. You're now searching for a strategy, a guiding light, to lead you through the process. Rest assured: this Lecture is here to provide exactly that, and we will draw on everything you've learnt in the previous Lectures to make it a practical reality. **Now it’s time to step up, face the code, and tame the chaos.**"
