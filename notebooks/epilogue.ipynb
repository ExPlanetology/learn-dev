    "And there we have it&mdash;the end of the course! Your mind is likely buzzing with new concepts and ideas about how to improve your scientific programming and structure your research around sustainable software practices. Mastery will take time, but with persistence, you’ll be rewarded with software projects that are robust, maintainable, and extensible. Even better, you’ll benefit from a global audience who may not only use your work but also contribute to its ongoing development!\n",

    "Ultimately, **writing code is not just about instructing machines&mdash;it’s about communicating ideas clearly and reproducibly to other humans**, including your future self. In that sense, software becomes a form of scholarship: a living artifact that evolves, invites critique, and contributes to the broader scientific conversation. Treat it with the same care and curiosity you bring to your research, and it will serve you, and others, for years to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course ends here, but the journey continues with every project you build and every effort you make to leave the code better than you found it.\n"
