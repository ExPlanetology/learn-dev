    "# Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, technical terms have been introduced only when needed, so as not to distract from the main ideas with unnecessary jargon. Nevertheless, it’s valuable to understand the terminology used in software engineering: it provides a shared language for discussing problems, solutions, and best practices with fellow developers and computer scientists. The following glossary collects key terms you’ll encounter in modern programming and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstraction**: A way of hiding unnecessary details to focus on the essential behaviour of a system. Good abstractions simplify; poor abstractions obscure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Application Programming Interface (API)**: The entry point to your application. It is the part users interact with to create objects, call functions, and receive or process output.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Smell**: A hint that something in the code may be poorly designed. Examples include long functions, unclear naming, deep nesting, or duplicated logic. Smells aren't bugs, but warning signs that refactoring may be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: An automated system that runs tests, linters, and other checks whenever code changes are pushed. CI ensures the codebase remains healthy and prevents broken code from being merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deterministic Behaviour**: When a program produces the same output given the same input, regardless of when or where it's run. Essential for scientific reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**: A core software principle that encourages eliminating duplication. If the same logic appears in multiple places, consolidate it into a single, clear implementation. This reduces bugs, eases maintenance, and keeps your codebase coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration Test**: A test that checks how multiple components work together. Useful for catching issues that don’t appear in isolated units but arise when systems interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interface**: The boundary where different parts of the system interact&mdash;such as function signatures, class methods, APIs, or data formats. Clear, stable interfaces make code easier to use and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Library Layer**: The back-end of your application, containing the foundational code that makes everything run. Users typically do *not* interact with this layer directly&mdash;it represents the \"hidden\" details of how your application works.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Profiling**: Measuring where time or memory is being spent in a program. Profiling guides optimisation efforts, helping you focus on real performance bottlenecks instead of guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Refactoring**: Improving the internal structure of code without changing its external behaviour. Refactoring enhances readability, flexibility, and maintainability, making future changes easier and safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Technical Debt**: The accumulation of design shortcuts, quick fixes, or outdated structures that make future work harder. Like financial debt, it must eventually be paid down&mdash;either by refactoring or rewriting&mdash;before it slows progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unit Test**: A small and focused test that verifies a single piece of functionality in isolation. Unit tests help prove correctness, catch regressions, and give you confidence to refactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**: A reminder not to implement features, abstractions, or generalisations “just in case.” Build only what the current problem requires. Over-engineering early creates unnecessary complexity and increases long-term maintenance costs."
